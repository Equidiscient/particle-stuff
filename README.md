First program I made in Processing 3. <br />
Always liked these so decided it would be a good idea to use it as a prompt for my first application in Java. Definitely not the best way to do this, I'm sure there's ways to transform each circle individually rather than redrawing the entire frame each time but this was a test done in a few hours. <br />
