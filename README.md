First program I made in Processing 3. <br />
Always liked these so decided it would be a good idea to use it as a prompt for my first application in Java. Definitely not the best way to do this, I'm sure there's ways to transform each circle individually rather than redrawing the entire frame each time but this was a test done in a few hours. <br />
I know the randomSeed() was called an unneccesary amount of times but I was noticing patterns in the spawning of the particles and it was a half-assed attempt to break said patterns, I'm sure they still exist despite this though.
